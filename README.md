The code provides a seamless movie search experience by using the OMDb API. It starts by capturing user input from a search box and fetching movie data matching the search term. The results are then displayed in a list format. When a user selects a movie from this list, the application fetches detailed information about the chosen movie, including its poster, title, release year, ratings, and more. This information is then presented in a detailed view. Additionally, the code ensures that the search results are hidden when the user clicks outside the search box, maintaining a clean and user-friendly interface. 
This setup makes for a responsive and interactive way to search and view movie information effortlessly.
